# kinodynamic-planning
Kinodynamic planning algorithm for ornithopters using a flight mathematical model optimizing the energy spent.

Run the main program with the "-default" option for performing a random simulation for the planning algorithm

Run the main example without any options and set the heuristic parameter for planning the ornithopter motion between specific flight states
