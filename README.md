# kinodynamic-planning
Kinodynamic planning algorithm to compute ornithopters trajectories that minimize energy consumption. A nonlinear dynamic model is used together with a tree-based heuristic search for trajectory planning.

Details of the algorithm and the benchmark experiments can be seen in the publication: 

*Kinodynamic Planning for an Energy-Efficient Autonomous Ornithopter*. F. Rodriguez, J. M. Diaz-Ba√±ez, E. Sanchez-Laulhe, J. Capitan and A. Ollero. 

Requirements:



Usage:

Run the main program with the "-default" option to perform a random simulation of the planning algorithm.

Run the main program without any options and set the heuristic parameters to plan trajectories with specific start and final flight states.
